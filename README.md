## Overview of Analysis 

In this analysis we used Javascript and HTML to create a webpage that holds a data table of UFO sightings. The webpage also includes a filter search that allows users to filter through UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country and shape. This functionality allows for a more in-depth analysis of the sightings.
